# RetailShops 
It is a project that provides RestFull api services developed with .Net Core, which calculates the discount of the chain store.

## Features
1. If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount
2. If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount
3. If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount.
4. For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45 as a discount).
